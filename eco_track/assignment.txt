Case Study One: The "Eco-Track" Student Sustainability Portal (Total Marks: 30) 
Background 
Kirinyaga University (KyU) wants to encourage students to track their personal carbon 
footprint reduction (e.g., using reusable bottles, planting trees, or carpooling). You are tasked 
with developing the initial backend prototype for the Eco-Track Portal. 
Tasks and Mark Distribution 
1. Server Architecture & Networking (5 Marks) 
A. Explain how the HTTP protocol facilitates the communication between a student's 
browser (the client) and your XAMPP server when they submit their sustainability 
data. (2 Marks) :
When a student submits sustainability data:

1.The browser (client) creates an HTTP POST request.

2.The request is sent to http://localhost/eco_track/process.php.

3.Apache (in XAMPP) receives the request.

4.Apache passes the request to the PHP interpreter.

5.PHP processes the data.

6.A response (HTML) is returned to the browser via HTTP.

7.The browser renders the response.

HTTP acts as the communication protocol that:

1.Defines request format (GET/POST)

2.Defines response codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found)

3.Transfers form data from client to server
B. Detail the specific directory path within XAMPP where your project  iles must be 
stored to be accessible via http://localhost/eco_track. (1 Mark) :
C:\xampp\htdocs\eco_track
Accessible via:

http://localhost/eco_track
C. Required XAMPP Service :

Apache Server

Apache:

Listens for HTTP requests

Executes PHP scripts

Returns responses to the browser

Without Apache running, PHP files cannot execute.
2. Environment Setup & Language Fundamentals (10 Marks)
