CASE STUDY TWO
KyU Masomo Resource Exchange
A1. DNS Role:

DNS converts: www.kyu.ac.ke into an IP address.

Process:

Browser queries DNS

DNS returns server IP

Browser sends HTTP request to that IP

Without DNS, users must enter raw IP addresses.
A2. Document Root Path:
C:\xampp\htdocs\masomo_exchange
The HTTP 200 OK status code indicates that the Apache server successfully received, processed, and responded to the client’s request without any errors.

In this application, it confirms that:

Apache is running

The server is reachable

The HTTP request-response cycle is functioning correctly
